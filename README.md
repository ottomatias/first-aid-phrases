The multilingual first aid phrasebook is designed to operate as a set of
mobile-optimised web pages, and provide useful phrases for first aid situations
where the person providing first aid don't speak the patient's language.

A selection of useful phrases are included, and adding another language is easy.

The project is powered by Middleman and reads the language YAML files, creating
an HTML file per language including all of the relevant phrases in an
easy-to-follow format.

**Notes about use**

At the moment, this is designed for my personal needs. I'm learning Finnish and
this is about giving me an easy way to learn useful phrases and question forms.

Anyone is welcome to try using it, as long as they understand that it is 
provided without any warranty, and should only be used by people with a
basic familiarity with the language they are working from.

A interpreter, professional or informal, is always better than a simple
phrasebook!

I'd suggest not trying to read any languages you aren't familiar with aloud. The
phrases appear quite large in a modal, so you can simply show them to the
patient.
